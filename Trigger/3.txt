3. Create a trigger w.r.tcustomer_detailstable.Increment the value of count_row (in cust_count table) whenever a new tuple is inserted and decrement the value of count_row when a tuple is deleted. Initial value of the count_row is set to 0.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cust_count() RETURNS trigger AS $cust_count$
DECLARE 
	count INT;
BEGIN
	SELECT * FROM cust_count INTO count;
 	IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN 
		IF count !=0 THEN
			UPDATE  cust_count SET count_row=count_row-1;
		END IF; 
	ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN 
		UPDATE  cust_count SET count_row=count_row+1;  	
	END IF;
	RETURN NEW;                                                         
END;
$cust_count$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER cust_count_change 
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON customer_details
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE cust_count();
